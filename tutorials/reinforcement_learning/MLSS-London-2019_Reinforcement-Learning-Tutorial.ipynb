    "### Author: [Katja Hofmann](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kahofman/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the [MineRL package](http://minerl.io/) to illustrate how a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent can learn to interact with the popular video game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/). MineRL was developed by a team led by [William H. Guss](http://wguss.ml/) and [Brandon Houghton](https://github.com/brandonhoughton) for the NeurIPS 2019 MineRL competition, hosted by AICrowd and sponsored by Microsoft. MineRL is based on [Project Malmo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/), developed at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/game-intelligence/). \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the deep learning framework [chainer](https://chainer.org/) to implement RL algorithms. The tutorial is designed to use as few chainer-specific constructs, but if you'd like to learn more about chainer, take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.chainer.org/en/stable/glance.html). Chainer is developed by [Preferred Networks (PFN)](https://www.preferred-networks.jp/en/), a co-organizer of the MineRL competition. The code here is designed for educational purposes. If you'd like to explore reinforcement learning and the MineRL competition further, take a look at the [chainerrl minerl baselines](https://github.com/minerllabs/quick_start/tree/master/chainerrl_baselines) provided by PFN.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to build an RL agent that learns to navigate: first in SimpleRooms, a task we implement from scratch, then in a MineRL task in Minecraft. Some parts of the tutorial are optional, as shown below - you can learn about key concepts in reinforcement learning and implement your first agent without installing the MineRL package.\n",

The resulting algorithm is a small modification of the original DQN algorithm. Implement this modification based on the paper, and repeat your experiments in SimpleRooms and MineRL using the updated algorithm. Can you achieve faster learning?"
